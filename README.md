This
assignment mainly tests your JavaScript skill. You will create two
HTML web pages, a CSS file and a JavaScript file.
Part
A)
Create
a web page that uses JavaScript to print the time of the visit to the
page. Instead of using the default conversion of a Date object
to a string, use the getHours getMinutes methods of
the Date class to produce something like this:
The
time is 19 minutes after 25 hours.
This
should appear as content in the page, not
a pop-up box.
This
is your home page, this page should contain your personal information
such as your name, your email address as well as one of the pictures
you choose (Do not use your own pictures). As
usual, create a link on this page direct to another ``Calculator''
page.
Part
B)
Create
a web page that uses JavaScript to build a calculator. The calculator
should contain all the numbers from 0-9, and functions of add, minus,
multiply, module and divide. Also include a clear button to clear the
result.  For the style of the calculator, please refer to one of the
following visual styles. You
do not have to match exactly the color, but the visual look should
look similar to one of these.
